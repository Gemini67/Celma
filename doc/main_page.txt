   \section  intro  Introduction

   CELMA stands for 'C++ Extension Library Modules for Application". It is a
   collection of modules, classes and functions that are often used in C++
   projects on *UX.<br>
   The most prominent member being the 'argument handler' library, a replacement
   for getopt()/Boost.Program Options.

   \subsection  build  Build Information

   In order to build the library, the following environment is required:
   \li g++, using C++ 17 standard features
   \li Boost library
   \li CMake

   \section  contents  Contents

   These are the main modules of CELMA:

   Module Name       | Description
   ----------------  | ----------------
   Argument handling | Contains the class celma::prog_args::Handler which provides easy and feature-rich argument handling.
   Reflection        | Create a structure and a class that provides reflection-like access to the members of the structure. Starting point is celma::reflection::REFLECT.
   Singleton         | Singleton pattern implementation with policies for static or dynamic object creation. See celma::common::Singleton.

     0.13.3 | 2017-02-18        | Added set of base classes for handling arbitraty value types.
     0.13.2 | 2017-02-18        | Improved handling of arguments with value type 'optional'.
     0.13.1 | 2017-02-07        | Some minor improvements for argument groups.

   \subsection  version_number  Version Number

   The CELMA version number will use the following format after the first
   1.0.0 release:<br>
   \c  \<major\>.\<minor\>.\<patch\>

   The handling of the version is like this:
   \li  The major number is changed if the interface of one or several classes
        have changed, and modifications to the project source code are necessary
        in order to use the new version.
   \li  The minor number is increased when new features are added to the library.
   \li  The patch number is increased when a bug fix was implemented on a
        production release.

   \subsection  git  git

   As mentioned before, the source code of CELMA is managed with git and
   available at https://www.github.com/Gemini67/Celma.

   There are two main branches in the git repository:
   \li master<br>
       Contains the current, tested, stable version of CELMA.
   \li develop<br>
       This is the default branch in the git repository to create a new version
       (branch) from.<br>
       Every time a new feature is developed or other major changes are
       necessary, a new branch is split from \c develop, the work done and
       tested and afterwards the changes are merged back unto \c develop.<br>
       Only stable, bug-free versions may be copied from develop to \c master.
